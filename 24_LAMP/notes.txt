Notes on installing apache on a droplet

- Verification process on github for the code was surpsisingly difficult
- when you ssh on mac, make sure you type "yes" instead of enter key
- make sure your ssh'ing to the root@ip
- apt-get install apache2 after apt-get update
- /etc/init.d/apache start to start
