Question 0 - We obtained an error saying that render_template was not defined. 

Question 1 - localhost:5000/my_foist_template

Question 2 - 'model_tmplt.html' is the template rendered at /my_foist_template. fooooo is replacing {{ foo }} as the title. coll is what is used to pass in collection, which will then be displayed on the webpage.
