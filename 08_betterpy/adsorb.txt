Group No Named - Patrick Ging, Ryan Wang, Hebe Huang Period 2

Questions:

What's the efficacy of opening occupations csv everytime the function is called. 

Does the pop function have a return value or a side effect?

What is the actual machenery behind random.choices() ? 


Comments:

I didn't realize that there was a function in the random library able to do the work for us. Likewise, I was unaware of a dictreader in the csv module that would've simplified things greatly.

I thought Ryan's code was much more concise and definetly a step up from ours in that regard.

Concerns:

Being able to use this capability resourcefully with bigger data, especially when there are more features to the data.
