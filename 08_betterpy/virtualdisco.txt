The command "$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" makes a python3 virtual environment in ~/myherozero.

A virtual environment is an environment with its own interpretor and library. That means that any package installed with pip in that environment can only be used in that environment (1). It's adventageous mostly because it allows you to isolate the libraries being used in your program and also makes deleting the environment when one's done really simple - you delete the folder.
